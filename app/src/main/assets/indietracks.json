Their debut album \u201cCourting Strong\u201d, produced by MJ from Hookworms, came out in 2014 and was included in NPR\u2019s top 50 albums of that year, winning them the epithet \u201cOne of Britain\u2019s best rock bands\u201d. Following a Glastonbury appearance at the personal invitation of Billy Bragg, they went on to play a number of festivals including End Of The Road. Their second album \u201cBlisters In The Pit Of My Heart\u201d was released via Fortuna POP! and Dirtnap Records in July last year, to critical acclaim from the likes of Pitchfork, Noisey, AV Club and Rough Trade, and went on to win the 2016 Drowned in Sound \u2018Neptune Prize\u2019.",

A joy from start to finish.\u201d Allmusic added that \u201cIt\u2019s hard to deny the brilliance of a band that can crank out an album as passionate, hook-filled and flat-out fiery as this\u201d while The Quietus described it as \u201cA wonderful album and a fine addition the canon.\u201d",

Kline initially built a reputation with her prolific catalogue of bedroom recordings and as a performer and advocate of New York\u2019s All Ages DIY scene. The beauty in Kline\u2019s writing does not lie within immense statements and large gestures, but instead can be found in her ability to examine situations and relationships with heartbreaking sincerity. In 2014 Kline and then-bandmate Aaron Maine released their first studio album as a two-piece, Zentropy. Within months of its release, Zentropy became one of the most critically acclaimed independent albums of the year and was named New York Magazine\u2019s #1 Pop album of 2014. The band soon added in members David Maine on bass, and Gabrielle Smith on keyboards, and their LP, Next Thing, came out in April 2016 to continued acclaim, including a Best New Music from Pitchfork. Frankie Cosmos is now a four-piece band, featuring David Maine on bass, Lauren Martin on keyboards, and Luke Pyenson on drums.",

A US re-issue of Consumer Complaints via Fat Cat records followed the next year and the band\u2019s highly anticipated 2nd LP Why Choose was released worldwide in autumn 2015. Dubbed as a \u201cband you need to hear\u201d by NME and \u201cArtist To Watch\u201d by SPIN, the band evokes revered touchstones Gang of Four, ESG, Delta 5 and the Slits though as Pitchfork reminds, \u201cthey never sound particularly dated or like a carbon-copy, a testament to the group\u2019s songwriting abilities.\u201d Rather, they embody the spirit of experimentation, social upheaval, (without becoming didactic) clashing gender politics and ethical change that defined their 70\u2019s counterparts and still ring true today. Their live shows are rallying calls to shake off the frustration, fear and self-doubt that can feel like an inescapable part of our culture.",

The purpose was to keep providing classic pop songs of love and hope, done with guitars and drums, but with cleaner sound and more classic keyboards. Over all these years people came and went, and sometimes came back, and left their imprint on three albums. The first one had a slightly Mod-ish sound. The second one was more folk-rock and the third and current one has a harder edge, letting overdrive in. CJS have played extensively in their native Spain but also abroad: Berlin, Glasgow, NYC and many times London and Liverpool, as well as Indietracks itself in 2009. They usually sing in Spanish but an English-sung EP was recorded in 2012 as a compliment to their numerous British friends.",

The specific function of the band was to tell the story of a group of people who found themselves drawn to an abandoned plant nursery in southern England. The band hoped that their messages were transmitted efficiently, broadcast via audio in the form of their d\u00e9but album \u2018Garden Centre\u2019. With their task well and truly complete, the members of Garden Centre have become distracted. Some members still obsess over semi-rural boredom and exploration. Others have the audacity to write love songs. The most cretinous members opt to write about energy drinks exclusively.

The album is a chronicle of the adventures with friends and broken hearts that happened along the way. Blissful romances play out with an economically devastated Greece as the backdrop, dreams are abandoned, humorous affairs intertwine with tragic incidents, self sarcasm is used as an antidote to bitterness and in the end what is left is celebration of our power as individuals and of love as the ultimate healer.",

While it is great to get away, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Indietracks 2017 takes place against a global backdrop of turbo-charged austerity, increasing racism, intolerance and injustice. The world is becoming a scary place, but there are things that we can do to make a difference and remain hopeful. Campaigning for change is more vital than ever \u2013 this workshop will look at some of the things we can do together to make a difference. Liz Ely works for a charity in Scotland which campaigns to prevent violence against women and girls, she is also a founder member of The Living Rent Campaign which won security of tenure for renters, and some limited rent controls in Scotland in 2015. In this workshop she will share some of her experiences, as well as introducing some practical tools for active campaigning.",
